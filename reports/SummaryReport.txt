Bivariate Analysis

1.Demographic Features
Gender (Chi² = 0.48, p = 0.486): No significant relationship with churn
SeniorCitizen (Chi² = 159.43, p < 0.001): Senior citizens show higher churn rates
        
Partner (Chi² = 158.73, p < 0.001): Customers with partners show lower churn rates
Dependents (Chi² = 189.13, p < 0.001): Customers with dependents have significantly lower churn rates

Strategic Insight: Family-oriented customers are more stable, suggesting family plans or bundled services could improve retention.


2.Account Info Features

Contract Type (Chi² = 1,184.60, p < 0.001)
Strongest predictor of churn:

    Month-to-month: Very high churn rate (~43%)
    One-year: Moderate churn rate (~11%)
    Two-year: Lowest churn rate (~3%)

Payment (Chi² = 648.14, p < 0.001)
    Electronic check: Highest churn risk payment method
    Automatic payment methods: Lower churn rates

Paperless billing (Chi² = 258.28, p < 0.001): 
    Customers with paperless billing show higher churn rates

Strategic Insight: Contract length is the most powerful predictor of churn. Incentivizing longer contracts could dramatically improve retention.

3.Service Features

Internet Service (Chi² = 732.31, p < 0.001)

    DSL customers: Lowest churn rate (~20%)
    Fiber optic customers: Moderate churn rate (~42%)
    No internet service: Extremely low churn rate (~7%)

Strategic Insight: Fiber optic customers represent the highest churn risk segment, requiring targeted retention strategies.

Online Services Impact

    OnlineSecurity (Chi² = 850.00, p < 0.001): Customers without online security show dramatically higher churn rates
    OnlineBackup (Chi² = 601.81, p < 0.001): Similar pattern - lack of backup services correlates with higher churn
    TechSupport (Chi² = 828.20, p < 0.001): Absence of tech support strongly predicts churn

Strategic Insight: Value-added services act as retention tools. Customers without these services are significantly more likely to churn.

Entertainment Services

    StreamingTV (Chi² = 374.20, p < 0.001): Moderate impact on churn
    StreamingMovies (Chi² = 375.66, p < 0.001): Similar moderate impact
    Both services show higher retention for customers who subscribe


Correlation Matrix Analysis

Tenure and Churn (-0.35) - longer-tenured customers are less likely to churn
TotalCharges and Churn (-0.20) - customers with higher total charges are less likely to churn

Implications:

Customer retention improves with tenure, suggesting importance of early customer satisfaction
Monthly charges show weak correlation with churn, indicating price sensitivity may not be the primary driver


Feature Engineering Success
custom feature engineering revealed two powerful predictive indicators:

**Services Score (0-4 scale):**Chi² = 338.97
- Measures customer engagement with add-on services
- **Distribution:** 40% of customers have 0 services, only 7% have all 4 services
- **Business Impact:** Higher service adoption correlates with lower churn risk

**Vulnerability Score (0-8 scale):**Chi² = 1307.20,
- Composite risk metric based on customer demographics and contract type
- **Risk Categories:**
  - 0-1: Low vulnerability (married, long-term contracts)
  - 2-4: Moderate vulnerability 
  - 5-8: High vulnerability (seniors, single, month-to-month contracts)
