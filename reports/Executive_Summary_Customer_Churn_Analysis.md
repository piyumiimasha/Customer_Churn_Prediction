## Key Findings & Insights

### 1. Data Quality & Preprocessing
- **Dataset Size:** 7,043 customers with 21 features
- **Data Quality Issues:** 11 missing values in TotalCharges (0.16% of data)
- **Successful Preprocessing:** Implemented robust data cleaning and feature engineering pipeline

### 2. Feature Engineering Success
Our custom feature engineering revealed two powerful predictive indicators:

**Services Score (0-4 scale):**
- Measures customer engagement with add-on services
- **Distribution:** 40% of customers have 0 services, only 7% have all 4 services
- **Business Impact:** Higher service adoption correlates with lower churn risk

**Vulnerability Score (0-8 scale):**
- Composite risk metric based on customer demographics and contract type
- **Risk Categories:**
  - 0-1: Low vulnerability (married, long-term contracts)
  - 2-4: Moderate vulnerability 
  - 5-8: High vulnerability (seniors, single, month-to-month contracts)

### 3. Critical Churn Risk Factors

**High-Risk Customer Profiles:**
1. **Contract Type:** Month-to-month contracts show significantly higher churn
2. **Demographics:** Senior citizens and customers without partners/dependents
3. **Service Engagement:** Customers with minimal service adoption
4. **Tenure:** New customers (< 12 months) are at highest risk
5. **Payment Method:** Electronic check users show higher churn propensity

**Service-Specific Insights:**
- **OnlineSecurity & TechSupport:** Critical retention services
- **InternetService:** Fiber optic customers may have different risk profiles
- **Contract Duration:** Strong inverse correlation with churn risk

### 4. Model Performance & Reliability

- **XGBoost:** Superior predictive accuracy with gradient boosting
- **CatBoost:** Strong performance on categorical features

**Key Performance Metrics:**
- **Accuracy:** 90%+ across all models
- **ROC-AUC:** 0.85+ indicating strong predictive power
- **Feature Importance:** Consistent ranking across models validates findings

**Most Important Predictive Features:**
1. Contract type and tenure
2. Monthly charges and total charges
3. Services Score and Vulnerability Score
4. Internet service type
5. Payment method
